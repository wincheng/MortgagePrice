# MortgagePrice
MortgagePrice is a calculator tool where a user inputs a mortgage term, loan amount, monthly payment amount, and interest rate to calculate the total interest paid and ending balance, if any, on a mortgage plan. The user can use this interest 'pricing' to compare different mortgage plans.

Future plans for MortgagePrice include adding more functionality for different calculations and moving the program to a web or app platform with a GUI.
